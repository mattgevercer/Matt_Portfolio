## [Project 1: Classifying Handwritten Digits](https://github.com/mattgevercer/Digit-Recognition)
* A computer vision program that shows the difference in accuracy for guessing handwritten digits between a regular dense neural network and a convolutional dense neural network. 
* Visualizes how accuracy of predicting validation data improves over epochs. 
* Achieved over 98% accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.

## [Project 2: Predicted House Prices](https://github.com/mattgevercer/Cali_Housing)
* A dense neural network to predict the price of houses in California. 
* Splits housing data into training and testing sets. 
* Utilizes a callback to stop training once MSE loss has dropped below 0.5. 
* Visualizes training loss versus validation loss over the epochs to guage overfitting in model.
